"""Simulation scenarios for the Claude Office Visualizer.

Each module exposes a single ``run(ctx)`` function that accepts a
:class:`~scripts.scenarios._base.SimulationContext` and drives the backend
event stream for one scenario. ``SCENARIOS`` is the canonical registry;
the CLI (``scripts/simulate_events.py``) imports it directly rather than
re-declaring the mapping.

Available scenarios
-------------------
- ``basic``      — Simple session: boss reads a file, spawns one agent, session ends.
- ``complex``    — Multi-agent workflow with context compaction and background tasks.
- ``edge_cases`` — Error paths, permission requests, and unusual event sequences.
- ``quick``      — Fast (~30 s) full-lifecycle smoke scenario.
- ``teams``      — Multi-session team scenario exercising the room-orchestrator merge.
- ``swarm``      — 12 DeepSeek-style workers (annex desks, roster, inspector chat log).
